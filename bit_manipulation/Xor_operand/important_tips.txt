//here we will be writing the main tips that we got in each of the question 

1. the xor oparator has one special ability:::::::

explaination

a^b = c
then c^a=b;
and c^b=a;

also suppose u are givern xor of n elements and u have to find one number missing and u have all the other number
xor the nos that u have then again xor them with the main whole xor given u will get the missing no 

2......
the xor of multiple elements work on each of the ith bit
..what i mean is
if u take xor of n numbers then 
the result ki ith bit will be the outcome of performing xoring the ith bit of all the numbers 
//this is a very modular way to check the things



3.......
remeber that the shifting operators are a very good way of doing things in xor u will find multiple uses for it here
bit masking is a preRequisite 


4. the & operation is used to check weather the two number have same bits or Not
