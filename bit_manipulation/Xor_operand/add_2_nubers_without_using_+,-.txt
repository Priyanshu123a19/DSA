Given two integers a and b, return the sum of the two integers without using the operators + and -.

 

Example 1:

Input: a = 1, b = 2
Output: 3

Example 2:

Input: a = 2, b = 3
Output: 5

 

Constraints:

    -1000 <= a, b <= 1000




Solution
class Solution {
public:
    int getSum(int a, int b) {
        //so ultimately to add 2 number we have to remember a veryu simple rule of thumb
        //get the first number and keep on using this as sum
        //seconf number for the carry purpose till it becomes zero

        while(b!=0){

            unsigned int carry = (a&b)<<1;

            //now finally lets generate the final results
            sum here
            a=a^b;
            carry here
            b=carry;
        }

        return a;
    }
};
