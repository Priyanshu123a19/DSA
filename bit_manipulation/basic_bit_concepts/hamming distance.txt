The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, return the Hamming distance between them.

 

Example 1:

Input: x = 1, y = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       ↑   ↑
The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.

Example 2:

Input: x = 3, y = 1
Output: 1

 

Constraints:

    0 <= x, y <= 231 - 1

Solution
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        unsigned int number1=x;
        unsigned int number2=y;


        //now over here we will make a new string for binary numbers
        string binary1=bitset<32>(number1).to_string();
        string binary2=bitset<32>(number2).to_string();

        int ans=0;
        int start=0;
        while(start<binary1.size()){
            if(binary1[start]!=binary2[start]){
                ans++;
            }
            start++;
        }

        return ans;
    }
